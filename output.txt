Foreword
The Internet is the operating system of global politics. Ideas, messages, news, information,
and money ricochet around the world in minutes, crossing time zones and borders in real
time. Charities, banks, corporations, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and ter-
rorist organizations all use the Internet to do business, to organize, and to speed communica-
tions. Internet technology is implicated in almost everything done in world politics today.
But the Internet is not the free operating zone that its early proponents expected. Contrary
to conventional wisdom, states have shown an increased willingness to intervene to control
communication through the Internet. And they have done so with precision and effectiveness.
At the beginning of the decade, few were aware of the scale of the problem. Advocacy and
rights organizations charged that a handful of countries were blocking access to Web sites,
but they had little evidence to support their claims. Good empirical knowledge of the scope
of the problem did not exist.
Four years ago, a group of scholars at the University of Toronto, Harvard, and Cambridge
(Oxford joined later) came together to begin systematic research on patterns of Internet cen-
sorship and surveillance worldwide. At the time, the project seemed very ambitious. The
researchers proposed to put together a combination of contextual political and legal research
and technical interrogations of the Internet in the countries under investigation. It relied heavily
on the work of partners working in the countries where governments were engaged in active
censorship. The project was extraordinarily challenging; in almost every case, the research
implied a direct threat to national security and put researchers’ personal safety at risk.
The project was ambitious in other ways as well. A transatlantic collaboration among four
universities is difficult to manage at the best of times, but the ONI includes dozens of
researchers and collaboration with nongovernmental, rights, and advocacy organizations all
over the world. The project is also truly interdisciplinary. It involves sociologists, lawyers, inter-
national relations scholars, political scientists, and some of the world’s most skilled computer
programmers.
From 2003 to 2006, the ONI collaboration paid handsome dividends. It has produced
eleven major country reports, reports that revealed a startling trend. States were aggressively
finding ways to filter and control access to information for citizens within their borders. The
reports were detailed, supported by strong evidence that had an immediate impact on policy
worldwide. The ONI’s China report was delivered before two U.S. congressional committees
and was featured in newspapers and on television around the world. The reports highlighted
the embarrassing evidence that major U.S. corporations were implicated in Internet censor-
ship practices. Once, the best and brightest of Silicon Valley were wiring the world; now, they
were profiting from their collaboration with governments who were censoring and blocking
websites. The ONI’s dogged investigations called into question the conventional wisdom
about the Internet’s open architecture.
The significance of the research that ONI has conducted goes beyond its analysis of Inter-
net surveillance and censorship. It speaks to fundamental questions of world politics, its struc-
ture, its power relationships, and its new forms of global control and resistance. The essays in
this volume engage with all these issues. The editors of Access Denied present not only
detailed overviews of their country investigations, but several incisive chapters that probe the
legal, theoretical, and political implications of the growth of Internet-content-filtering practices
worldwide.
Access Denied tells us unmistakably that the Internet is one of the most important—and
most contested—terrains of global politics. It is being fought over by states, civil society
organizations, and corporations. The essays in this volume do a superb job of educating us
about the new battlefield of global politics.

Preface
This book is a testament to collaboration. About five years ago, it became clear to several of
us—at the University of Cambridge, Harvard Law School, and the University of Toronto—that
we might accomplish more by working together, across institutions and continents, than we
could by going it alone. Since that time, the Oxford Internet Institute has joined our team,
along with more than fifty researchers around the globe. Collaboration is not easy; we have
had our share of struggles along the way to keep our partnership functioning effectively. Nei-
ther the analytical chapters of this volume nor the new global data set that we have compiled,
on which our analytical work relies, would be possible without the partnership that joins us.
The insight that brought us together as collaborators was the sense that the architecture of
the Internet was changing rapidly—and that these changes would have far-reaching implica-
tions. One of the forces at work is that states are using technical means, in addition to other
kinds of controls, to block access to sites on the Web that their citizens seemed to wish to
access. We set out, together, to enumerate these technical restrictions as they emerged, to
track them over time and across states and regions, and to set them into a broader context.
Though we have published many of our findings to our Web site (http://www.opennet.net) and
will continue to do so, this book is our first effort to tie the many strands of our shared work
together into a single fabric.
Just as we shared a sense of the importance of this area of inquiry, we realized also that
this phenomenon could not properly be understood without bringing to bear a series of aca-
demic disciplines to analyze it and to set it into a fulsome context. The way we have
approached our work, which begins with technical enumeration, required technologists
among us to develop a new methodology for testing for choke points in the Internet. Political
scientists and international relations theorists hold another piece of the puzzle, as do those
with expertise in regional studies. Those of us who study and practice international law
and how it relates to information technologies understand another part of the whole. Our
shared view is that interdisciplinary research is the only way truly to understand our field in all
its complexity.
Most important of all, there are those people on the ground, in the places where the state is
seeking to impose control over the Internet, who have shed particular light upon what is hap-
pening in the places we are studying. Many of these people take risks every day in the interest
of promoting human rights, the rule of law, and other universally good causes. Many of these
people have put themselves in harm’s way, in one fashion or another, to help make this book
